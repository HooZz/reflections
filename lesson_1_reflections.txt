How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u game_old.js game_new.js

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    First of all, it will make more accurate in storing the history of changes.
    It will allow me to pay more attention to the code itself and to savings it.
    I always can look back and check what approach I have

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With the manual one I can just forget to save different versions.
    Automatic will not reflect the logic.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is focus on software development where all the files are interrelated,
    but in Google Docs the main focus is just editing of documents one by one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can see also the changes(commits) that were done. I can compare any 
    commit with any other commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now I don't worry if I creat a bug, I can always come back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Run the next couse and use Git properly
